# Thanks!

Thanks for dropping an issue! To make it easier for us to work on your issue, we'd love it if you could formulate your issue as a scenario using a 'given...when...then' structure. Based on that we can build a test for the issue using [Behat](http://behat.org/en/latest/). You'll then be able to see the progression of your test when our tests run! try to keep your issue as simple as possible rather than doing more than one - remember you can always create new issues for each problem. This also helps us deal with them more efficiently.

# What is the context for your issue or request?

<!--
	What page were you on? Are you logged in or logged out? What browser are you using?

  For example:
  - 'Given that I am on the home page using Chrome'
  - 'Given that I am logged in as a content editor and on the 'Create a blog' page using Safari'
  - 'Given that I am on the "Creating a Digital Identity" page at "https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/digital-identity/creating-digital-identity"'
-->

# What action do you want to take within that context?

<!--
	Did you click a button? Try to fill in a form? Using a link? Changing device orientation? Remember the context you gave above.

  For example:
  - 'When I click the 'Save' button'
  - 'When I try to close the accordion'
  - 'When I rotate my mobile phone to landscape mode'
-->

# What do you expect to happen when you take that action?

<!--
  Describe what you then expected to happen.

  For example:
   - 'Then I should see the new index card on the home page'
   - 'Then I should navigate to the given link'
   - 'Then the images on the cards should change size'
-->

# Any other information?

<!--
	If there is anything else you think might be relevant, just make a note here.
-->

# Screenshots

<!--
    Screenshots are great to help diagnose issues so you don't have to describe them in huge amounts of detail.
