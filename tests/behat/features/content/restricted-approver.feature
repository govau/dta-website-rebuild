@api

Feature: Restricted authors
  In order to provide users with basic content
  As an approver
  I need to be able to create, manage and maintain content in a limited way.

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "Restricted approver" role
    And "page" content:
    | title     | field_introduction     | field_body     | field_summary  |
    | test page | test page introduction | test page body | test summary 1 |

    @content @restricted-approver

    Scenario: Edit content
      Then I should be able to edit a page
      And I should be able to edit a landing_page
      And I should be able to edit a landing_page_level_2
      And I should be able to edit a govcms_event
      And I should be able to edit an external_link

      @content @dtg-approver
      Scenario: Publish content
        When I am on "test-page"
        And I select "Published" from "Change to"
        And I press "Apply"
        Then I should see the text "The moderation state has been updated"
