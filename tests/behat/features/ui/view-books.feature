Feature: Viewing books
In order to consume books
As an anonymous user
I need to be able to view them in different ways.

Background:
  Given "book" content:
  | title          | field_body       | field_summary     | moderation_state | status |
  | Test book      | Test book body   | Test book summary | published        | 1      |
  | Test book page | Test book body 2 | Test book summary | published        | 1      |
  And I am logged in as a user with the "Book author" role
  And I am on "test-book"
  When I click "Edit" in the "content" region
  And I select "- Create a new book -" from "Book"
  And I press "Save"
  And I am on "test-book-page"
  And I click "Edit" in the "content" region
  And I select "Test book" from "Book"
  And I press "Save"
